It carves through the planet’s highlands like a wound from an ancient past, plunging up to 8 kilometers deep and spanning as wide as 600 kilometers. If placed on Earth, the canyon would extend from New York to Los Angeles and could swallow the entire Grand Canyon many times over. Discovered in 1971 by NASA’s Mariner 9 spacecraft, it remains one of the most breathtaking and mysterious features of the Red Planet. Scientists believe the valley was born from the stretching of Mars’ crust near the Tharsis volcanic region, later widened by landslides, erosion, and perhaps even ancient rivers. Today, Valles Marineris stands as both a monument to Mars’ violent geological history and a key to understanding whether the planet once harbored liquid water — or even life.",
