## 2. The Martian Atmosphere

- **Composition:** 95.32% carbon dioxide, 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, 0.13% oxygen, 0.08% carbon monoxide.  
- **Density:** About 1% of Earth’s atmosphere.  
- **Pressure:** ~6 millibars (Earth’s is 1013).  
- **Clouds:** Thin layers of water-ice and carbon dioxide clouds form seasonally.  
- **Dust:** Extremely fine, iron-rich dust particles dominate the sky, giving Mars its reddish hue.  
- **Wind Speeds:** Can reach 100 km/h (60 mph) during dust storms.  
- **Global Dust Storms:** Occur roughly every 5–10 Earth years, sometimes enveloping the entire planet.  
- **Sound Speed:** ~240 m/s at surface pressure — slower than on Earth due to thin air.

## 3. Climate and Seasons

Mars experiences **four distinct seasons**, caused by its axial tilt similar to Earth’s.  
However, each season lasts roughly **twice as long**, because Mars takes almost two Earth years to orbit the Sun.

| Season | Northern Hemisphere Duration | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spring** | 194 sols | Dust storms and warming temperatures |
| **Summer** | 178 sols | Thawing of CO₂ ice, peak surface temperatures |
| **Autumn** | 142 sols | Cooling phase, return of polar frost |
| **Winter** | 154 sols | CO₂ snow and ice accumulation at poles |

- Mars’ **elliptical orbit** makes seasons uneven: southern summers are short and hot, northern summers are long and mild.  
- **Temperature fluctuations** are dramatic due to the thin atmosphere — up to 100°C difference between day and night.

## 4. Surface and Geology

### Major Surface Features
- **Olympus Mons:** The tallest volcano in the Solar System (21.9 km high).  
- **Valles Marineris:** The largest canyon system, stretching 3,000 km long and 8 km deep.  
- **Tharsis Region:** Volcanic plateau hosting massive shield volcanoes.  
- **Hellas Planitia:** One of the deepest impact basins, 7 km deep and 2,300 km wide.  
- **Utopia Planitia:** Vast plain that once may have held an ancient ocean.  
- **Noctis Labyrinthus:** Maze-like terrain of collapsed crust and tectonic troughs.

### Geological Composition
- Dominated by **basaltic rocks**, volcanic plains, and iron-rich dust.  
- **Iron oxides (hematite)** cause Mars’ red color.  
- **Silicates, sulfates, and perchlorates** are widespread in soils.  
- Evidence of **hydrated minerals** (clays, carbonates) suggests past water activity.  
- The crust averages **50 km thick**, compared to Earth’s 40 km.  
- **No active plate tectonics**, meaning volcanoes grew in one place for billions of years.

## 5. Water on Mars

- Mars once had **flowing rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans**.  
- Ancient channels and deltas indicate **sustained water flow** 3–4 billion years ago.  
- **Permafrost** lies beneath much of the surface.  
- **Polar ice caps** contain both **water ice and dry ice (CO₂)**.  
- **Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL)** — dark streaks that appear seasonally — may involve briny liquid flows.  
- **Subsurface radar data** (MARSIS, SHARAD) suggest **underground ice deposits** and potential brine lakes near the poles.

## 6. Magnetic Field and Interior

- Mars **no longer has a global magnetic field**.  
- Ancient magnetized rocks show it once had a **magnetosphere** billions of years ago.  
- The loss of this field likely allowed **solar wind to strip the atmosphere**.  
- Interior structure:
  - **Core:** Iron, nickel, sulfur — ~1,800 km radius, partially liquid.  
  - **Mantle:** Silicate rock, convective early in Mars’ history.  
  - **Crust:** Thick, stable, iron-rich.

NASA’s **InSight mission** (2018–2022) detected marsquakes, confirming an **active interior**, though much less dynamic than Earth’s.

## 7. Moons of Mars

Mars has two small, irregular moons — likely captured asteroids.

| Moon | Diameter | Orbital Period | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phobos** | 22.4 km | 7.66 hours | Orbits very close; will crash or break apart in ~50 million years |
| **Deimos** | 12.4 km | 30.3 hours | Farther and more stable orbit |

- Both are **tidally locked**, always showing the same face to Mars.  
- Japan’s **MMX mission (2026)** will collect samples from Phobos to study its origin.

## 8. Potential for Life

- Mars was **potentially habitable** around 3.5–4 billion years ago.  
- Evidence:
  - Clay and carbonate minerals indicate **neutral-pH water**.  
  - Organic molecules detected by **Curiosity** and **Perseverance**.  
  - Methane plumes observed by orbiters and rovers, suggesting **geological or biological sources**.  
- Today, surface conditions are harsh — radiation, dryness, and cold make survival unlikely.  
- **Subsurface regions**, shielded from radiation, remain the most promising sites for microbial life.

  - Long travel time (~6–9 months each way).  
  - Radiation exposure.  
  - Dust toxicity.  
  - Life support and habitat sustainability.  
- Advantages: Abundant **water ice**, **CO₂ atmosphere** (usable for oxygen production), and **solar energy**.

## 11. Curiosities and Fun Facts

- **Color:** The sky appears **pinkish** during the day due to scattered red dust.  
- **Sunsets:** Blue at dusk — opposite of Earth’s red sunsets.

- **Dust Devils:** Can reach 8 km tall; some cleaned solar panels on the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.  
- **Meteorites:** Over 300 Martian meteorites have been found on Earth.  
- **Auroras:** Occur locally over magnetic crust regions, not globally like Earth’s.

- **Temperature Variance:** Equatorial noon can reach +30°C, but nights drop below −80°C.  
- **Name Origin:** Named after **Mars**, the Roman god of war, due to its red color.  
- **Cultural Impact:** Inspires fiction from *The War of the Worlds* to *The Martian*.

- **Artificial intelligence** is increasingly used to map terrain and analyze rover data.  
- **Terraforming** remains theoretical but inspires long-term discussions of habitability.  
- Mars continues to serve as a **template for planetary evolution** — showing how a once-wet world can become dry, cold, and barren.
