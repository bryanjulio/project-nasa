## Detailed Information

### Location and Discovery

Olympus Mons is located on the western hemisphere of Mars, between the northwestern edge of the Tharsis region and the eastern edge of Amazonis Planitia. It is about 1,200 km (750 mi) from the other three large Martian shield volcanoes: Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. It had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica. Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.

### Formation and Age

Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, which means it was built up over time by fluid lava flows. This gives it a low, broad profile with gentle slopes. The volcano formed during the Martian Hesperian Period, with eruptions continuing into the Amazonian Period, making it the youngest of Mars' large volcanoes. Scientists believe it is relatively young in geological terms, possibly only a few million years old, and there is speculation that it may still be active.

The immense size of Olympus Mons is attributed to Mars' lower gravity, slow-moving tectonic plates (or lack thereof), and prolonged volcanic activity, allowing lava to accumulate in one spot over billions of years.

### Physical Characteristics

The volcano is surrounded by a well-defined scarp, or cliff, that is up to 6 km (3.7 miles) high in places. A wide, annular depression, or moat, about 2 km (1.2 mi) deep surrounds its base, thought to be caused by the volcano's immense weight pressing down on the Martian crust.

The summit caldera (the central depression) is a complex of overlapping craters, with a total width of 85 km (53 miles) and a depth of almost 3 km (1.9 miles). The caldera likely formed from recurrent collapse following the drainage of magma after flank eruptions.

### Composition

Olympus Mons is primarily composed of basaltic lava flows, similar to shield volcanoes found on Earth. Its general composition includes:

*   Approximately 44% silicates
*   Around 17.5% iron oxides, which contribute to the planet's red coloration
*   About 7% aluminum
*   Roughly 6% magnesium
*   Approximately 6% calcium
*   A notable 7% sulfur dioxide

Spectroscopic analyses have also identified minerals such as pyroxenes, olivines, and iron oxides. Additionally, unique minerals like vanadinite and halloysite have been found, with halloysite indicating the past presence of water.

### Atmosphere at the Summit

The atmosphere at the summit of Olympus Mons is extremely thin and cold. The typical atmospheric pressure at its peak is about 72 pascals, which is roughly 12% of the average Martian surface pressure of 600 pascals. For comparison, the atmospheric pressure at the summit of Mount Everest on Earth is 32,000 pascals.

The Martian atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide (over 95%), with only trace amounts of oxygen, rendering it unbreathable for humans. Temperatures at the summit can plummet to approximately -112 degrees Fahrenheit (-80 degrees Celsius). Despite the extremely low density—about 100 times less dense than Earth's atmosphere—high-altitude orographic clouds and airborne Martian dust are still observed drifting over the summit.

### The Aureole

Surrounding the main edifice of Olympus Mons is a vast, grooved region known as the aureole. The origin of the aureole is still debated, but it may be the result of landslides or gravity sliding off the flanks of an ancestral volcano.

### Tharsis Region

The Tharsis region is a huge volcanic plateau that rises about 10 km (6.2 miles) above the surrounding plains. It is home to some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including Olympus Mons and the three large shield volcanoes of the Tharsis Montes: Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons.

The Tharsis bulge has had a profound impact on the geology of Mars. The immense weight of the plateau has created a network of fractures and grabens (fault-bounded valleys) in the surrounding crust.

### Exploration History

*   **Early Observations (Late 19th - Early 20th Century):** Astronomers first observed Olympus Mons from Earth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, identifying it as an albedo feature named "Nix Olympica" (Latin for "Olympic Snow").
*   **Mariner 9 (1971):** NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft was the first to extensively map the area and confirmed Olympus Mons as an immense volcano.
*   **Viking Program (Late 1970s):** The Viking orbiters captured detailed images, allowing scientists to study its structure and composition.
*   **Subsequent Orbital Missions (1990s - Present):** Later missions, including the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, ESA's Mars Express, and NASA's Mars Odyssey, have continued to provide high-resolution imagery and data. These missions have enabled topographical studies, analysis of its geological layers, and the recent discovery of water ice frost on its peaks.

## 3D Model Descriptions

### Official 3D Model (NASA)

This is Olympus Mons on Mars - the Solar System's largest volcano at 27 kilometres elevation. The model was generated with NASA's Solar System Treks. Vertical exaggeration set to 2.0.

### Unofficial 3D Model

Olympus Mons is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. The volcano has a height of nearly 25 km. It is the largest volcano, the tallest planetary mountain, and the second tallest mountain in the Solar System compared to Rheasilvia on Vesta. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period.
